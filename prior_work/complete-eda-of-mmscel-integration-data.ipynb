    "# 1. Overview\n",
    "The goal of this competition is to better understand the relationship between different modalities in cells. The goal of this notebook is to gain a better understanding of the associated data. This equips us with the knowledge needed to make good decisions about model design and data layout.\n",

    "**This is a work in progress. If any aspect needs clarification, please let me know. My understanding of genetics is very limited. Feel free to point out anything that is false.**\n",

    "During transcription in cells, there is a known flow of information. DNA must be accessible to produce RNA. Produced RNA is used as a template to build proteins. Therefore, one could assume that we can use knowledge about the accessibility of DNA to predict future states of RNA and that we could use knowledge about RNA to predict the concentration of proteins in the future. In this challenge, we want to learn more about this relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins. We thus need to capture information about three distinct properties of a cell:\n",
    "* chromatin accessibility\n",
    "* gene expression\n",
    "* surface protein levels\n",

    "    <p style=\"padding: 4px;color:white;\"><b>1.2 How are those three properties of a cell presented?</b></p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we have a look at how the information about those properties of a cell is laid out, we must note that the methods used to obtain the data do not capture all properties at once. We have two distinct methods for testing. The first one is the \"10x Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression\" short \"multiome\" test. The second one is the \"10x Genomics Single Cell Gene Expression with Feature Barcoding technology\" short \"citeseq\" test.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the multiome test, we can measure **chromatin accessibility and gene expression**. With the citeseq test, we can measure **gene expression and surface protein levels**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will have data about chromatin accessibility and surface protein levels once (from multiome and citeseq, respectively). And we will have data about gene expression two times, one from each test. With that out of the way, let's dive into how the data is actually presented.\n",

Thus, to load the full table into memory while preserving the 32bit accuracy, we will need about 90 GB of RAM. This is quite a lot. Therefore, we will only look at a chunk of the data here and also don't load the whole dataset into memory while training or doing transformations.

One key difference is that both have unique genes that are only measured in one test. Later, we will also investigate if the comparability of the data is due to preceding normalization of the raw data obtained by the tests and also address the question of what an expression value of e. g. 2.4 actually means."

    "For each cell, we see the **day** column tells us on which day the test was performed. The test that was actually performed is shown in the **technology** column. Note that experiments started on day 1, therefore the first tests were performed one day after the cells were injected with Neupogen for the first time ([compare here](https://allcells.com/research-grade-tissue-products/mobilized-leukopak/)). For each of the four donors, we have a **donor** ID giving us information about the origin of the cell. Lastly, there is a **cell_type** column. The cell types are labels assigned by humans. They might be imprecise and this information is not available for test data since it would be possible to draw conclusions about surface protein levels, for example. It is not clear if we can make use of that later (maybe we can use it for creating balanced splits, but we will see).\n",
